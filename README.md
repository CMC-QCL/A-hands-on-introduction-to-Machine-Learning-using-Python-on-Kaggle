# [QCL Workshop] A hands-on introduction to Machine Learning using Python on Kaggle

## Introduction:
The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning. We will be working in Python and using real-world datasets from Kaggle, the machine learning platform most suited for the “learn-by-doing” philosophy. The series is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python, but it is also designed adaptively so that you will be challenged even if you have some familiarity with machine learning tools.

The two session workshop is going to be very hands-on and will focus on how to work with datasets. Instead of comprehensively covering every tool and concept, you will learn the minimal but most useful tools and concepts quickly and learn how to find resources to explore further.
