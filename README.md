## Introduction:
The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning. We will be working in Python and using real-world datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the machine learning platform most suited for the “learn-by-doing” philosophy. This hands-on series is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python and will cover the minimal but most useful tools and concepts to get you started to work on a data science project. In the first session, we will explore a couple datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and practise feature engineering using `pandas`. In the second session, we will learn the classification and regression algorithms along with other important concepts of practical use in machine learning and train models using `scikit-learn` for the datasets from the previous session.

This series is a condensed version of the previous four-session [Machine Learning workshop series at Harvey Mudd College](http://www.aashitak.com/ML-Workshops/) by the same instructor. 

## Instructor: 
Aashita Kesarwani (Scientific Computing Specialist, Harvey Mudd College)

## Teaching Assistants: 
Jeho Park (CMC, QCL Director), Lan Phan (CMC '19), Bruno Youn (CMC '19)

## Registration
- Part 1: [Friday, April 26th from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM](https://intro-to-ml-kaggle-part1.eventbrite.com/)
- Part 2: [Friday, May 3rd from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM](https://intro-to-ml-kaggle-part2.eventbrite.com/)

We recommend you to register for both workshops as they are designed to cover different topics.

Part 1 workshop will cover the basics of data manipulation with more hands-on than part 2. Part 2 will be more on machine learning techniques with more presentaions than part 1.

## Workshop Topics
See [Machine Learning workshop series at Harvey Mudd College](http://www.aashitak.com/ML-Workshops/) for more information. This 2-day workshop will be a condensed version of the original HMC workshop.
