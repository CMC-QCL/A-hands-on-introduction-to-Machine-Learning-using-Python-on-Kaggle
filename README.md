# [QCL Workshop] A hands-on introduction to Machine Learning using Python on Kaggle

## Introduction:
The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning. We will be working in Python and using real-world datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the machine learning platform most suited for the “learn-by-doing” philosophy. This hands-on series is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python and will cover the minimal but most useful tools and concepts to get you started to work on a data science project. In the first session, we will explore a couple datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and practise feature engineering using `pandas`. In the second session, we will learn the classification and regression algorithms along with other important concepts of practical use in machine learning and train models using `scikit-learn` for the dataset from the previous session.

This series is a condensed version of the previous four-session [Machine Learning workshop series at Harvey Mudd College](http://www.aashitak.com/ML-Workshops/) by the same instructor.
