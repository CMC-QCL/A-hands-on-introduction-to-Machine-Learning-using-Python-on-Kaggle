## Introduction:
The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning. We will be working in Python and using real-world datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the machine learning platform most suited for the “learn-by-doing” philosophy. This hands-on series is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python and will cover the minimal but most useful tools and concepts to get you started to work on a data science project. In the first session, we will explore a couple datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and practise feature engineering using `pandas`. In the second session, we will learn the classification and regression algorithms along with other important concepts of practical use in machine learning and train models using `scikit-learn` for the datasets from the previous session.

This series is a condensed version of the previous four-session [Machine Learning workshop series at Harvey Mudd College](http://www.aashitak.com/ML-Workshops/) by the same instructor. 

## Instructor: 
Aashita Kesarwani (Scientific Computing Specialist, Harvey Mudd College)

## Teaching Assistants: 
Jeho Park (CMC, QCL Director), Lan Phan (CMC '19), Bruno Youn (CMC '19)

## Registration
- Part 1: [Friday, April 26th from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM](https://intro-to-ml-kaggle-part1.eventbrite.com/)
- Part 2: [Friday, May 3rd from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM](https://intro-to-ml-kaggle-part2.eventbrite.com/)

We recommend you to register for both workshops as they are designed to cover different topics.

Part 1 workshop will be more hands-on and cover the data exploration, data manipulation, and feature engineering using `pandas`. It is a precursor to Part 2 that will cover machine learning concepts along with model building using `scikit-learn`.

## Workshop Topics
See [Machine Learning workshop series at Harvey Mudd College](http://www.aashitak.com/ML-Workshops/) for more information. This 2-day workshop will be a condensed version of the original HMC workshop.

## FAQ

Q: Should I register for both part 1 and part 2 workshops?  
> We recommend you to attend both workshops. Part 1 workshop will be more hands-on and cover the data exploration, data manipulation, and feature engineering using `pandas`. It is a precursor to Part 2 that will cover machine learning concepts along with model building using `scikit-learn`.

Q: Should I bring my own laptop? 
> For CMC fork: No, you don’t have to. RN12 has over 50 Windows computers and you can log in the computers using your CMC credential. For non-CMC forks, yes, you should bring your laptop. We can also provide a loaner laptop if you need one.

Q: How can I cancel my ticket?
> Your confirmation ticket email has a link, “View and manage your order online.” Follow that link and cancel your ticket.

Q: Should I be affiliated with CMC? 
> Yes. The workshops will also be open to all Claremont Colleges if there are more seats left.

Q: What is Kaggle?
> Kaggle is a cloud platform for data science and machine learning community. Competitions, data sets, and computing resources are available for free. Check it out -- [Kaggle website](http://www.kaggle.com).

Q: Where can I get the topics, data, and Python files for the workshops?
> The workshop topics, data and files will be available on [A hands on introduction to Machine Learning using Python on Kaggle before the workshop](https://github.com/CMC-QCL/A-hands-on-introduction-to-Machine-Learning-using-Python-on-Kaggle).
